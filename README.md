* The application is no different than normal mobile contact applications. Our application, targeted towards insurance agents, will ease them in storing their customer's information.

  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.

* Features:
  - Customizable insurance and client categories
  - Connections between customers
  - Client’s insurance contract → end date, price, company
  - Advanced search (by location, contract, date, company etc)
  - Appointment (todo) → when list out can sort by date
  - Transaction/contract
  - Contacts become inactive after a specific period


* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
