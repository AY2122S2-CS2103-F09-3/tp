## Project: Mr. Agent

Mr. Agent is a desktop app for managing contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Mr. Agent can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
